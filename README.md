<h2>Two Factor Authentication(2FA) :  </h2> 

The primary objective of this project is to enhance the security of our .NET C# website by implementing Two-Step Authentication (2FA). Two-Step Authentication is a crucial security measure that adds an extra layer of protection to user accounts, reducing the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches. The specific goals of this project are as follows:
 Implement a Two-Step Authentication mechanism for user login on our website.

 For the project I have used app-based authentication for 2FA.

 Ensure a seamless and user-friendly experience for enabling and using 2FA.

 Safeguard user accounts and sensitive data from unauthorized access.

 Monitor and log 2FA usage for security auditing and analysis.
